                  My name is Josh Kaye I’m a friendly, self motivated
                  individual that always aims to achieve the best possible
                  standards at anything thrown my way in life. I’ve had
                  experience in working in both a team environment and as
                  an individual. I’m a very practical oriented person who
                  easily picks up on anything, my main strengths are more
                  technology based but I’m also an extremely polite person.
